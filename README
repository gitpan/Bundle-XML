Bundle::XML - CPAN Bundle for XML-related modules

Version 0.11 - 2000-07-23
Bundled by: Colin Muller <colin@durbanet.co.za>

To install this Bundle file locally:
perl Makefile.PL
make install

Then, for a full list of the modules which this bundle
installs, use:
perldoc Bundle::XML

Finally, to install the XML modules which the bundle lists:
perl -MCPAN -e 'install Bundle::XML'

This bundle gathers together those XML-related modules on CPAN which are
intended to enable the parsing, use and creation of XML documents in
general. It excludes modules which are intended to work with specific
XML document types or with specific non-XML data sources.

Modules for which the installation process may fail because they require
C and/or C++ libraries include XML::Parser, XML::LibXML, XML::LibXSLT
and XML::Sablotron:

XML::Parser requires the expat library, available from
expat.sourceforge.net.

XML::LibXML requires the libxml library and XML::LibXSLT requires the
libxslt library, both available from www.xmlsoft.org.

XML::Sablotron requires the Sablotron library, available from
www.gingerall.com.

I have ignored the fact that certain parts of certain modules require
specific versions of Perl.
