Bundle::XML - CPAN Bundle for XML modules and their dependencies

Version 0.1 - 2000-02-27
Bundled by: Colin Muller <colin@durbanet.co.za>

To install this Bundle file locally:
perl Makefile.PL
make install

Then, for a full list of the modules which this bundle
installs, use:
perldoc Bundle::XML

Finally, to install the XML modules which the bundle lists:
perl -MCPAN -e 'install Bundle::XML'

This bundle gathers together all of the modules in the XML
directory of CPAN, along with some other XML-related modules,
and (I think) all of the modules on which these depend.

In this version (0.1), XML::DOM and XML::XQL are installed via 
hard-wired links to versions earlier than the current ones, 
because the current versions fail to install automatically. 
During the install, CPAN will attempt but fail to install the 
latest versions of these from libxml-enno-1.00. Ignore the
errors: although this fails, XML::DOM and XML::XQL are still 
installed, but at the earlier versions (1.25 and 0.61 
respectively).  Other modules dependent on them should still 
work as well.

At one stage during the install, you will be prompted to
provide the XML::Edifact installer with some input; the 
installation will pause until you do so.

Left out of this version (because make fails):
XML::Filter::Hekeln

In this version, I have ignored the fact that certain parts 
of certain modules require specific versions (5.005 or 
5.004 or 5.003) of Perl.  Sorry.
